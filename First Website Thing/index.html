            <h2>What Is Music</h2>
            <p>Music is the conjunction of sounds joining together to make a symphony. <br> music has been known to bring people together in groups, tell stories, and has also been used in protest. <br> music has grown and changed over time and has existed since the conception of the human species. <br> given how diverse music genres have become its near impossible to have full knowledge on every genre. <br> as well as the abundant amount of subgenres for each genre that exists <br> below is a list of genres i personally enjoy listening to. </p>




        







        <h2>Music Genres</h2>
        <dl>
            

            <dt>Rock</dt>
            <dd>Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated in the 1950s, rooted in blues, rhythm and blues, and country. <br>It's typically characterized by a strong backbeat, electric guitars, bass, drums, and energetic vocals. <br> Over time, it has evolved into numerous subgenres, from classic rock and punk to metal and indie,<br> influencing global music and culture for decades.</dd>

            <dt>Alternative</dt>
            <dd>Sometimes called Indie, alternative is a genre which doesnt conform to other genres, making itself into its own genre, sometimes recognized as a subgenre. <br>sometimes new genres get formed by alternative music, like plutonium jazz, which you should not listen to.</dd>

            <dt>Metal</dt>
            <dd>Metal is a genre of rock music that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, known for its heavy distortion, powerful riffs, aggressive vocals, and emphatic rhythms. <br>Often darker and more intense than other rock styles, metal has spawned numerous subgenres like thrash, death, black, and doom metal, <br> each with its own distinct sound and themes. Bands like Black Sabbath, Metallica, and Iron Maiden helped define and popularize the genre.</dd>

            <dt>Pop</dt>
            <dd>Pop is a broad and accessible genre of popular music known for its catchy melodies, simple song structures, and strong focus on hooks and choruses.  <br> Emerging in the mid-20th century, pop draws from various styles—rock, dance, R&B, and more—while prioritizing mass appeal and radio-friendly production. <br> Artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Taylor Swift have helped shape and redefine the genre over the decades.</dd>

            <dt>Punk</dt>
            <dd>Punk is a raw and fast-paced genre of rock music that emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against mainstream rock and social norms. <br> It's characterized by short, aggressive songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and rebellious, often politically charged lyrics. <br> Punk emphasizes DIY ethics and anti-establishment attitudes, with bands like The Ramones, Sex Pistols, and The Clash leading the movement.</dd>

        <h3>Music Subgenres</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Shoegaze</dt>
            <dd>Shoegaze is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged in the late 1980s, characterized by dreamy, ethereal soundscapes, <br>heavy use of guitar effects like reverb and distortion, and subdued vocals that blend into the music. Its name comes from <br> the performers' tendency to stare at their effects pedals while playing. Key influences include My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, and Ride.</dd>


            <dt>Progressive</dt>
            <dd>Progressive (often "prog") is a style descriptor used across genres—like progressive rock or progressive metal—characterized by complex song structures, technical proficiency, experimental sounds, and conceptual themes.  <br> Emerging in the late 1960s, progressive music often features long compositions, unusual time signatures, and influences from classical, jazz, and electronic music. It aims to push musical boundaries beyond conventional formats. <br> Key examples include bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson, and Dream Theater. </dd>
            
            <dt>Modern</dt>
            <dd>"Modern" isn't a genre on its own, but when used to describe music—like modern rock, modern pop, or modern jazz—it typically refers to contemporary styles or updated takes on traditional genres. <br> It often incorporates current production techniques, digital elements, and evolving trends while maintaining core aspects of the original genre. The term is fluid and context-dependent, often used to distinguish newer sounds from "classic" or "traditional" styles.</dd>
            
            <dt>Classic</dt>
            <dd>Like “modern,” classic isn't a standalone genre but a descriptor used to refer to influential, foundational music from a past era—typically the mid-20th century. <br> For example, classic rock includes iconic rock music from the 1960s to 1980s, known for its lasting impact and timeless appeal. <br>“Classic” often implies a sense of nostalgia, enduring popularity, and cultural significance, marking music that helped define or shape its genre.</dd>

            
           

            <dt>Post Hardcore </dt>
            <dd>Post hardcore matches the intensity of Punk rock, but has more creativity added into it <br> similar to
                the alternative genre/subgenre it cant stand on its own, yet it sounds different from the traditional
                form of said genre. <br><em>a fancy way of saying alternative punk basically</em></dd>
